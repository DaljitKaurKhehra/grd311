    <h2 class="article-head">Roasted Beet Hummus with Pita Chips</h2>
    <p>Here's a great idea for a delicious Thanksgiving appetizer: Beautifully purple-coloured beet hummus served with pita chips. This&nbsp;homemade hummus is so much better than any store bought one, and adds a nice splash of colour to the table! It’s really easy and quick to make (if you have a blender, it would take  no more than 10 minutes). The beets give it a natural sweet note, while complimenting  the tart tahini and pungent garlic added in. I highly recommend trying this hummus this year, as it has a ton of health benefits too, like Vitamin C!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 medium-sized beets</li>
      <li>400 g can chickpeas</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons tahini paste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon cumin</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Black sesame to garnish</li>
      <li>1-2 Bags of Pita Chips&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 F or 200 C</li>
      <li>Wrap each washed and dried beet in aluminum foil and roast for 1 hour. Pierce with a fork to check the readiness. Then let them cool and peel them.</li>
      <li>Combine roughly chopped beets with chickpeas, tahini paste, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, sea salt and black pepper in a food processor and blend until smooth, gradually adding the olive oil.</li>
      <li>Add extra salt and/or pepper for taste</li>
      <li>Transfer to a bowl and top with black sesame to garnish&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Bake pita chips on 400 F or 200 C for 5 to 7 minutes or until golden and crispy. Serve with roasted beet hummus.&nbsp;</li>

    <h2 class="article-head">A Favourite Vegan Entrée: Roasted Butternut Squash Soup!</h2>
    <p>Cozy up with a bowl of warm, creamy butternut squash soup this Thanksgiving! This butternut squash soup is super creamy and full of rich roasted butternut squash flavor. It also makes for a great "make-a-day-ahead" dish for any time in the Fall or Winter season!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large butternut squash,&nbsp; halved vertically and seeds removed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped shallot&nbsp;</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>4 garlic cloves, pressed or minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon maple syrup</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>3 to 4 cups  vegetable broth, as needed</li>
      <li>1 to 2 tablespoons butter, to taste</li>
      <li>Handful of black beans, to top&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the butternut squash on the pan and drizzle each half with just enough olive oil to lightly coat the squash on the inside (about ½ teaspoon each). Rub the oil over the inside of the squash and sprinkle it with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Turn the squash face down and roast until   tender and completely cooked through, about 40 to 50 minutes (don’t worry if the skin or flesh browns—that’s good for flavor). Set the squash aside until it’s cool enough to handle, for about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile,&nbsp;in a large soup pot, warm 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat until shimmering (if your blender has a soup preset, use a medium skillet to minimize dishes.) Add the chopped shallot and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until the shallot has softened and is starting to turn golden on the edges, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, stirring frequently. Transfer the contents to your stand blender&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Use a large spoon to scoop the butternut squash flesh into your blender. Discard the tough skin. Add the maple syrup, nutmeg and a few twists of freshly ground black pepper to the blender. Pour in 3 cups vegetable broth, being careful not to fill the container past the maximum fill line (you can work in batches if necessary, and stir in any remaining broth later).</li>
      <li>Make sure to securely fasten the lid. Blend on high (or select the soup preset, if available), being careful to avoid hot steam escaping from the lid. Stop once your soup is ultra creamy and warmed through.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>If you would like to thin out your soup a bit more, stir in the remaining cup of broth. &nbsp;</li>
      
      <li>Add&nbsp;1 to 2 tablespoons butter or olive oil, to taste, and blend well. Taste and stir in more salt and pepper, if necessary.</li>
      <li>If&nbsp;your soup is piping hot from the blending process, you can pour it into serving bowls. If not, pour it back into your soup pot and warm the soup over medium heat, stirring often, until it’s nice and steamy. Top individual bowls with minimal black beans.&nbsp;</li>
